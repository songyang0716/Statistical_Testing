### Some statistical testing methods that could be used in online experimentation ###

#### Repeated Measurement Experiments ####
 
0. Advantage of Repeated Measurement:
- Repeated measurement from a single subject provide more information than a single measurement obtained from a single subject, which improves the power of our study
- Each subject can serve as his/her own control (Diff-diff thought)
- We could separate the aging effects (changes over time effects, accumulative effects for online experimentation) 

1. Why difference-in-difference method could be wrong in experiment analysis<br/>
- One group pre-post test<br/>
- Two groups pre-post test<br/>

2. How to do the correct analysis for longitudinal dataset ?
- Paired T-Test for Two Time Points
- GEE Model
- Mixed Effects Model
